Production-grade connector for ingesting Microsoft Teams data into Databricks using the Microsoft Graph API v1.0.

## Overview

The Microsoft Teams connector enables you to:
- Extract teams, channels, messages, and members from Microsoft Teams
- Support both snapshot (full refresh) and CDC (incremental) ingestion modes
- Leverage Microsoft Graph API v1.0 with OAuth 2.0 authentication
- Ingest structured data with proper schema definitions into Delta tables

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Register Azure AD Application

1. **Navigate to Azure Portal**
   - Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
   - Sign in with an account that has **Global Administrator** or **Application Administrator** role

2. **Register New Application**
   - In the left navigation, select **Microsoft Entra ID** (formerly Azure Active Directory)
   - Select **App registrations** → **New registration**
   - Configure the registration:
     - **Name**: `Microsoft Teams Connector` (or your preferred name)
     - **Supported account types**: Select "Accounts in this organizational directory only (Single tenant)"
     - **Redirect URI**: Leave blank (not needed for Application permissions)
   - Click **Register**

3. **Copy Essential Credentials**

   After registration, copy these values (you'll need them for the connector):

   - **Application (client) ID**: Found on the Overview page
   - **Directory (tenant) ID**: Found on the Overview page

   Example values (these are sample GUIDs, not valid credentials):

   ```text
   Tenant ID:  a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890  (example only)
   Client ID:  f9e8d7c6-b5a4-3210-9876-543210fedcba  (example only)
   ```

4. **Create Client Secret**
   - In your app registration, navigate to **Certificates & secrets**
   - Under **Client secrets**, click **New client secret**
   - Add a description: `Databricks Teams Connector`
   - Select expiration: **24 months** (recommended) or custom duration
   - Click **Add**
   - **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Copy the **Value** immediately (it won't be shown again)

   Example secret value (this is a sample format, not a valid secret):

   ```text
   Client Secret: abc123~xyz789.aBcDeFgHiJkLmNoPqRsTuVwXyZ  (example only)
   ```

### Step 2: Configure API Permissions

1. **Add Microsoft Graph Permissions**
   - In your app registration, navigate to **API permissions**
   - Click **Add a permission** → **Microsoft Graph** → **Application permissions**

2. **Select Required Permissions**

   Add each of the following permissions:

   | Permission | Category | Required For |
   |------------|----------|--------------|
   | `Team.ReadBasic.All` | Microsoft Teams | Read team names and basic properties |
   | `Channel.ReadBasic.All` | Microsoft Teams | Read channel names and properties |
   | `Group.Read.All` | Microsoft Teams | Read group names and properties |
   | `ChannelMessage.Read.All` | Microsoft Teams | Read messages in all channels |
   | `TeamMember.Read.All` | Microsoft Teams | Read team membership information |

   **How to add each permission:**
   - Click **Add a permission** → **Microsoft Graph** → **Application permissions**
   - Search for the permission name (e.g., "Team.ReadBasic.All")
   - Check the box next to the permission
   - Click **Add permissions**
   - Repeat for each permission

3. **Grant Admin Consent** ⚠️ **CRITICAL STEP**

   After adding all permissions:
   - Click **Grant admin consent for [Your Organization Name]**
   - Confirm by clicking **Yes**
   - Verify all permissions show a **green checkmark** under "Status"

   **Without admin consent, the connector will fail with 403 Forbidden errors.**

### Step 3: Verify Setup

Your **API permissions** page should look like this:

```text
API / Permissions name              Type         Status
Microsoft Graph
  Team.ReadBasic.All               Application  ✓ Granted for [Org]
  Channel.ReadBasic.All            Application  ✓ Granted for [Org]
  Group.Read.All                   Application  ✓ Granted for [Org]
  ChannelMessage.Read.All          Application  ✓ Granted for [Org]
  TeamMember.Read.All              Application  ✓ Granted for [Org]
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT - Chats Not Supported:**

- The Microsoft Graph API `/chats` endpoint does NOT support Application Permissions
- It only works with Delegated Permissions (interactive user login)
- This connector uses Application Permissions for automated/scheduled pipelines
- Therefore, **chats cannot be ingested**
- Supported tables: teams, channels, members, messages, message_replies

### Step 4: Setup in Databricks

After registering your Azure AD application and granting permissions, you need to configure the connector in your Databricks workspace.

#### Create a Unity Catalog Connection

A Unity Catalog connection can be created in two ways:

**Option 1: During Pipeline Creation (Recommended)**

The easiest way is to create the connection while setting up your first ingestion pipeline. This flow is shown in the [Run Your First Pipeline](#run-your-first-pipeline) section below.

**Option 2: Pre-create Connection via Catalog UI**

You can also create the connection separately before creating a pipeline:

1. **Navigate to Catalog → External Data**
   - In your Databricks workspace, click **Catalog** in the left sidebar
   - Click **External Data** at the top
   - Navigate to the **Connections** tab

2. **Create Connection**
   - Click **Create connection** button
   - This will open the connection setup wizard

3. **Configure Connection**
   - **Connection name**: Enter a name for your connection (e.g., `microsoft_teams_connection`)
   - **Connection type**: Select the appropriate type for community connectors
   - Configure credentials (see below)

   **Required Credentials** (use your actual values from Azure Portal - examples shown are NOT valid):

   | Key | Value | Description |
   | --- | ----- | ----------- |
   | `tenant_id` | `a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890` (example) | Azure AD tenant ID (GUID format) |
   | `client_id` | `f9e8d7c6-b5a4-3210-9876-543210fedcba` (example) | Application (client) ID (GUID format) |
   | `client_secret` | `abc123~xyz789.aBcDeFgHiJkLmNoPqRsTuVwXyZ` (example) | Client secret value (from Azure Portal) |
   | `externalOptionsAllowList` | `tableName,tableNameList,tableConfigs,team_id,channel_id,message_id,start_date,top,max_pages_per_batch,lookback_seconds,fetch_all_teams,fetch_all_channels,fetch_all_messages,use_delta_api,max_concurrent_threads` | **REQUIRED:** Comma-separated list of allowed options. Includes framework options (tableName, tableNameList, tableConfigs) and connector-specific table options. |

   **📝 Note on Credentials:**
   - Enter your actual Azure AD credentials directly in the connection
   - Use the tenant ID, client ID, and client secret from Step 1
   - Credentials are stored securely in the Unity Catalog Connection
   - No need to pass credentials in `table_configuration` - they come from the connection!

4. **Create Connection**
   - Click **Create** to save the connection
   - The connection will now be available when creating ingestion pipelines

The connection can also be created programmatically using the Unity Catalog API or Databricks CLI.

**Note:** The custom connector source code is registered during pipeline creation (see next section). You don't need to register it separately.

#### Run Your First Pipeline

Create an ingestion pipeline using the Databricks UI. This is the recommended approach as it guides you through all the necessary steps:

1. **Navigate to Jobs & Pipelines**
   - In your Databricks workspace, click **Jobs & Pipelines** in the left sidebar
   - Click **Create new** dropdown
   - Select **Ingestion pipeline** (Ingest data from apps, databases and files)

2. **Add Custom Connector**
   - In the "Add data" screen, scroll down to **Community connectors** section
   - Click **Custom Connector** button
   - In the "Add custom connector" dialog:
     - **Source name**: Enter `microsoft_teams` (must match the directory name in the repository)
     - **Git Repository URL**: Enter `https://github.com/eduardohl/lakeflow-community-connectors-teams`
     - Click **Add Connector**
   - The connector will now appear in the Community connectors list

3. **Select Your Connector**
   - After adding the custom connector, you'll return to the "Add data" screen
   - Find and click on your **microsoft_teams** connector in the Community connectors section
   - This will open the connection setup wizard

4. **Configure Connection (STEP 1)**
   - The wizard shows "Ingest data from Microsoft_teams"
   - Under "Connection to the source":
     - If you already created a connection (Option 2 above), select it from the dropdown
     - If you haven't created a connection yet, click **Create connection** to create one now
   - Example connection names: `lakeflowcommunityconnectormsteams`
   - Click to proceed to **STEP 2**

5. **Configure Ingestion Setup (STEP 2)**
   - **Pipeline name**: Enter a descriptive name (e.g., `LakeflowCommunityConnectorMSTeams`)
   - **Event log location**:
     - **Catalog**: Select a catalog (e.g., `eduardo_lomonaco` or your user catalog)
     - **Schema**: Select or create a schema for event logs (e.g., `ms_teams_connector`)
   - **Root path**: Enter the path where connector assets will be stored
     - Example: `/Users/eduardo.lomonaco@databricks.com/ms_teams_connector`
     - This is where the pipeline will store metadata and checkpoint information
   - Click **Create** to create the ingestion pipeline

6. **Configure Pipeline Source Code** ⚠️ **REQUIRED STEP**
   - Once created, you'll be redirected to your pipeline details page
   - Click **Open in Editor** to edit the generated source code
   - The pipeline generates a skeleton Python file (e.g., `ingest.py`) in your workspace
   - **You MUST replace the auto-generated code with actual pipeline configuration**

   **Option A: Use the sample code** (recommended for getting started)
   - Copy the contents of [`sample-ingest.py`](sample-ingest.py) into your `ingest.py` file
   - Update the `connection_name` variable to match your actual connection name
   - Example: Change `connection_name = "microsoft_teams_connection"` to `connection_name = "lakeflowcommunityconnectormsteams"`
   - Adjust `DESTINATION_CATALOG`, `DESTINATION_SCHEMA`, and `START_DATE` as needed
   - Save your changes

   **Option B: Write custom pipeline specification**
   - Define your own pipeline spec following the pattern in `sample-ingest.py`
   - See [Usage Example](#usage-example) section below for details
   - Configure which tables to ingest and their options
   - Save your changes

7. **Run Pipeline**
   - After saving your code, return to the pipeline details page
   - Click **Dry run** to test the configuration (recommended first)
   - Click **Run pipeline** to start ingesting data
   - After the first run, you'll see a visual graph showing the ingestion flow

## Prerequisites

### Microsoft 365 Environment

- Microsoft 365 tenant with Microsoft Teams enabled
- Teams with data to ingest (teams, channels, messages)
- **Global Administrator** or **Application Administrator** role for app registration

### Databricks Environment

- Databricks workspace with Unity Catalog enabled
- Permissions to create UC connections
- Delta Live Tables (DLT) support for declarative pipelines

---

## Supported Tables

The Microsoft Teams connector supports **5 core tables** with two ingestion modes:

**Ingestion Modes:**
- **Snapshot (Full Refresh)**: Fetches all data on every run. Recommended for small, infrequently changing datasets (teams, channels, members).
- **CDC (Change Data Capture/Incremental)**: Only fetches new or modified records after the last cursor value. Recommended for large, frequently changing datasets (messages, message_replies).

### Summary Table

| Table | Ingestion Type | Cursor Field | Parent IDs Required | Auto-Discovery Mode |
|-------|---------------|--------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| teams | Snapshot | - | None | - |
| channels | Snapshot | - | `team_id` OR `fetch_all_teams` | `fetch_all_teams=true` |
| messages | **CDC** | `lastModifiedDateTime` | `team_id`, `channel_id` OR `fetch_all_channels` | `fetch_all_channels=true` |
| members | Snapshot | - | `team_id` OR `fetch_all_teams` | `fetch_all_teams=true` |
| message_replies | **CDC** | `lastModifiedDateTime` | `team_id`, `channel_id`, `message_id` OR `fetch_all_messages` | `fetch_all_messages=true` |

**Usage Notes:**

- Use this table to capture threaded conversations (replies to messages)
- Requires manually specifying which parent messages to track
- To find message IDs with replies:
  1. First ingest the messages table
  2. Query for messages that likely have threads (e.g., by subject, date range)
  3. Use the connector's test suite to verify which messages have replies
  4. Add those message IDs to your pipeline configuration
- The `parent_message_id` field enables joining replies back to parent messages
- Same schema as messages table for consistency

---

## Automatic Discovery (fetch_all Modes)

The connector supports automatic discovery modes that eliminate the need to manually configure parent resource IDs. Instead of running pipelines iteratively to discover teams, channels, and messages, you can use `fetch_all` options to automatically discover all resources in one run.

### Overview

| Table | Auto-Discovery Option | What It Does | Still Required |
|-------|----------------------|--------------|----------------|
| channels | `fetch_all_teams=true` | Discovers all teams, then fetches channels for each | Credentials only |
| members | `fetch_all_teams=true` | Discovers all teams, then fetches members for each | Credentials only |
| messages | `fetch_all_channels=true` | Discovers all channels in a team, then fetches messages for each | `team_id` |
| message_replies | `fetch_all_messages=true` | Discovers all messages in a channel, then fetches replies for each | `team_id`, `channel_id` |

### Benefits

**Before (Manual Configuration):**
```python
# Step 1: Run pipeline to get teams
# Step 2: Query teams table, copy IDs
TEAM_IDS = ["abc-123-...", "def-456-...", ...]  # Manual copy-paste

# Step 3: Run pipeline to get channels
# Step 4: Query channels table, copy IDs
CHANNEL_IDS = [
    {"team_id": "abc-123-...", "channel_id": "xyz-789-..."},
    {"team_id": "abc-123-...", "channel_id": "uvw-101-..."},
    # ... dozens or hundreds of manual entries
]
```

**After (Automatic Discovery):**
```python
# Just fetch_all - credentials from UC Connection
{
    "fetch_all_teams": "true"  # ← That's it! Connector discovers everything
}
```

### Example: Zero-Configuration Ingestion

The simplest possible configuration - ingest all teams, channels, and members without any manual ID configuration:

```python
# Credentials automatically injected from UC Connection
pipeline_spec = {
    "connection_name": "microsoft_teams_connection",
    "objects": [
        # 1. Teams (fetches all teams)
        {
            "table": {
                "source_table": "teams",
                "destination_catalog": "main",
                "destination_schema": "teams_data",
                "destination_table": "teams"
            }
        },
        # 2. Channels (auto-discover ALL teams)
        {
            "table": {
                "source_table": "channels",
                "destination_catalog": "main",
                "destination_schema": "teams_data",
                "destination_table": "channels",
                "table_configuration": {
                    "fetch_all_teams": "true"  # Auto-discover all teams
                }
            }
        },
        # 3. Members (auto-discover ALL teams)
        {
            "table": {
                "source_table": "members",
                "destination_catalog": "main",
                "destination_schema": "teams_data",
                "destination_table": "members",
                "table_configuration": {
                    "fetch_all_teams": "true"  # Auto-discover all teams
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

**Result:** Single pipeline run ingests all teams, all channels across all teams, and all members across all teams - zero manual configuration. Credentials automatically injected from UC Connection.

### Example: Auto-Discover All Channels for Messages

Fetch messages from ALL channels in a specific team (useful for large teams with many channels):

```python
{
    "table": {
        "source_table": "messages",
        "destination_catalog": "main",
        "destination_schema": "teams_data",
        "destination_table": "messages",
        "table_configuration": {
            **creds,
            "team_id": "your-team-id",  # Still need to specify which team
            "fetch_all_channels": "true",  # ← Auto-discover all channels
            "start_date": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
            "top": "50",
            "max_pages_per_batch": "100"
        }
    }
}
```

**Result:** Discovers all channels in the team, then fetches messages from each channel. No need to manually list channel IDs.

### Example: Auto-Discover All Messages for Replies

Fetch threaded replies from ALL messages in a specific channel:

```python
{
    "table": {
        "source_table": "message_replies",
        "destination_catalog": "main",
        "destination_schema": "teams_data",
        "destination_table": "message_replies",
        "table_configuration": {
            **creds,
            "team_id": "your-team-id",
            "channel_id": "your-channel-id",  # Still need to specify which channel
            "fetch_all_messages": "true",  # ← Auto-discover all messages with replies
            "start_date": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
            "top": "50",
            "max_pages_per_batch": "100"
        }
    }
}
```

**Result:** Discovers all messages in the channel, then fetches replies for each message (skipping messages with no replies). No need to manually identify which messages have threads.

### How It Works

The connector implements discovery in two phases:

**Phase 1: Discovery**
- Fetches parent resources (teams, channels, or messages)
- Uses lightweight queries with `$select=id` for efficiency
- Handles pagination to discover all parent resources

**Phase 2: Ingestion**
- Iterates through discovered parent IDs
- Fetches child resources for each parent
- Gracefully handles inaccessible resources (404/403) by skipping them
- Merges all results into a single output stream

### Performance Considerations

**Automatic discovery is safe for production use:**
- Connector respects API rate limits (100ms between requests, automatic retry on 429)
- Uses pagination limits (`max_pages_per_batch`) to prevent runaway queries
- Skips inaccessible resources instead of failing
- Discovery phase uses minimal bandwidth (`$select=id` queries)

**When to use fetch_all modes:**
- **Use for channels/members:** When you have many teams and want all data without manual configuration
- **Use for messages:** When a team has many channels and you want complete coverage
- **Consider carefully for message_replies:** Fetching all replies can be expensive for channels with many messages. Use `start_date` to limit scope.

**When to use manual IDs:**
- When you only want data from specific teams/channels
- When you need fine-grained control over which resources to ingest
- For testing with a small subset of data

### Complete Example

For complete working examples, see the [Configuration Examples](#configuration-examples) section below which includes:

- Configuration-based ingestion (incremental workflow)
- Simple teams-only ingestion
- **Fully automated ingestion (zero configuration)** - See [sample-ingest.py](sample-ingest.py)
- Message replies ingestion (threaded conversations)

### Testing

Before running in production, verify your setup with the unit test suite:

```bash
# Run the comprehensive test suite
pytest tests/unit/sources/microsoft_teams/test_microsoft_teams_lakeflow_connect.py -v
```

---

## Usage Example

**For a complete, production-ready example, see [`sample-ingest.py`](sample-ingest.py).**

This demonstrates:

- All 5 tables (teams, channels, members, messages, message_replies)
- Full auto-discovery (no manual IDs needed)
- Credentials from UC Connection (automatically injected)
- Delta API for fast incremental sync
- Parallel fetching with ThreadPoolExecutor

### Simple Example

```python
from databricks.labs.community_connector.pipeline.ingestion_pipeline import ingest
from databricks.labs.community_connector.libs.source_loader import get_register_function

# Setup
source_name = "microsoft_teams"
connection_name = "microsoft_teams_connection"  # Credentials from UC Connection

# Register connector
register_lakeflow_source = get_register_function(source_name)
register_lakeflow_source(spark)

# Pipeline spec - credentials automatically injected from connection
pipeline_spec = {
    "connection_name": connection_name,
    "objects": [
        {
            "table": {
                "source_table": "teams",
                "destination_catalog": "main",
                "destination_schema": "teams_data",
                "destination_table": "lakeflow_connector_teams"
            }

## Table Configuration Options

### Common Options (All Tables)

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `top` | String (integer) | `50` | Page size for pagination (max: 50 for messages/message_replies, 999 for others) |
| `max_pages_per_batch` | String (integer) | `100` | Maximum pages to fetch per batch (safety limit) |

### Parent-Child Options

| Option        | Type          | Required For                                 | Description                                    |
|---------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `team_id`     | String (GUID) | channels, members, messages, message_replies | Parent team identifier                         |
| `channel_id`  | String (GUID) | messages, message_replies                    | Parent channel identifier                      |
| `message_id`  | String (GUID) | message_replies                              | Parent message identifier (for thread replies) |

### CDC Options (messages and message_replies)

| Option             | Type              | Default | Description                                                     |
|--------------------|-------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `start_date`       | String (ISO 8601) | None    | Initial cursor for first sync (e.g., `2025-01-01T00:00:00Z`)   |
| `lookback_seconds` | String (integer)  | `300`   | Lookback window in seconds (see critical note below)           |

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** `lookback_seconds` must be >= your pipeline run frequency to avoid missing messages.

#### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Lookback Window Must Match Run Frequency

The `lookback_seconds` parameter determines how far back from the current checkpoint the connector will fetch data on each run. **This must be at least as long as your pipeline run frequency** to avoid missing messages.

| Pipeline Frequency | Minimum `lookback_seconds` | Recommended Value  | Example                        |
|--------------------|----------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------|
| Every 5 minutes    | `300` (5 min)              | `600` (10 min)     | Continuous/real-time ingestion |
| Every 15 minutes   | `900` (15 min)             | `1800` (30 min)    | Frequent updates               |
| Hourly             | `3600` (1 hour)            | `7200` (2 hours)   | Regular business hours sync    |
| Every 6 hours      | `21600` (6 hours)          | `43200` (12 hours) | Periodic updates               |
| Daily              | `86400` (24 hours)         | `172800` (48 hours)| Once-daily batch processing    |
| Weekly             | `604800` (7 days)          | `1209600` (14 days)| Weekly reports                 |

**Why This Matters:**

- If you run **daily** with `lookback_seconds="300"` (5 min), you'll **miss 23 hours and 55 minutes** of messages
- The lookback creates an overlap window to catch late-arriving or edited messages
- No duplicate risk: CDC deduplicates automatically using message `id` as primary key
- Longer lookback = safer, but slightly more API calls due to overlap

**Example Configurations:**

```python
# Continuous sync (every 5-10 minutes)
"lookback_seconds": "600"  # 10-minute lookback

# Hourly sync
"lookback_seconds": "7200"  # 2-hour lookback

# Daily sync (common for batch processing)
"lookback_seconds": "172800"  # 48-hour lookback (2 days)
```

### Auto-Discovery Options

| Option | Type | Default | Tables | Description |
|--------|------|---------|--------|-------------|
| `fetch_all_teams` | String (boolean) | `false` | channels, members, messages | Set to `"true"` to automatically discover and fetch from all teams |
| `fetch_all_channels` | String (boolean) | `false` | messages | Set to `"true"` to automatically discover and fetch from all channels in the specified team |
| `fetch_all_messages` | String (boolean) | `false` | message_replies | Set to `"true"` to automatically discover and fetch replies from all messages in the specified channel |

**Note:** When using `fetch_all` modes, you don't need to specify the corresponding parent ID. For example, if `fetch_all_teams="true"`, you don't need to provide `team_id`.

### Performance Tuning Options

| Option | Type | Default | Tables | Description |
|--------|------|---------|--------|-------------|
| `use_delta_api` | String (boolean) | `true` (messages), `false` (message_replies) | messages | Use Microsoft Graph Delta API for server-side filtering (O(changed) vs O(all)). **NOT supported for message_replies** - will fail with 400 error if enabled. |
| `max_concurrent_threads` | String (integer) | `10` | message_replies | Number of parallel threads for fetching replies |

**Delta API (`use_delta_api`):**
- **Enabled by default for messages table only**
- **NOT supported for message_replies** - Microsoft Graph returns `400 BadRequest: "Change tracking is not supported against 'microsoft.graph.chatMessage'"` for the replies endpoint
- Provides up to **1000x performance improvement** for large channels with few changes (messages only)
- Tracks message changes server-side (only changed items returned)
- Does NOT track reaction changes (reactions are not supported by this connector)
- For message_replies, the connector automatically uses legacy client-side filtering mode

**Concurrent Threads (`max_concurrent_threads`):**

- Controls parallelism for reply fetching
- Higher values = faster ingestion, but more API calls
- Adjust based on your API rate limits
- Typical range: 5-20 threads

---

## Limitations

### Reactions Not Supported

**Message reactions (emoji reactions like 👍, ❤️, etc.) are not tracked by this connector.**

**Why?**

- Microsoft Graph Delta API does not track reaction changes
- Tracking reactions requires polling individual messages periodically
- This approach does not scale well for large organizations with millions of messages
- The polling-based implementation would generate excessive API calls and data volume over time

**Workaround:**

If you need reaction data for specific use cases:

1. Query the `reactions` field in the `messages` or `message_replies` tables (reactions are included as an array field in message records)
2. Implement custom polling logic outside of this connector for specific high-value messages/channels
3. Use the Microsoft Graph API directly for targeted reaction queries

## Best Practices

### Start Small
- Begin with a **single team** and **one or two tables** (e.g., teams + channels)
- Validate data shape and schema before expanding
- Test with a small date range for messages

### Use Incremental Sync

- For **messages** and **message_replies**, always use CDC mode with `start_date`
- Set appropriate `lookback_seconds` (default: 300 = 5 minutes) to catch late updates
- Monitor cursor progression in pipeline event logs

### Tune Batch Sizes

- Use `top=50` for messages and message_replies (API maximum)
- Use `top=100` for other tables (balance efficiency and response size)
- Adjust `max_pages_per_batch` based on dataset size (default: 100 pages)

### Respect Rate Limits
- Microsoft Graph API throttles at ~1,000-2,000 requests/minute
- The connector implements:
  - 100ms delay between requests (10 req/sec)
  - Automatic retry with exponential backoff on 429 errors
  - Respect for `Retry-After` headers
- Avoid running multiple concurrent pipelines with the same credentials

### Handle Deletions

- **Soft deletes:** Messages and message_replies have `deletedDateTime` field (filter on `deletedDateTime IS NULL` for active content)
- **Hard deletes:** Not tracked by API; rely on full re-sync or change notifications

### Schedule Appropriately

- **Snapshot tables** (teams, channels, members): Daily or weekly refresh (infrequent changes)
- **CDC tables** (messages, message_replies): Hourly or continuous (for near real-time)
